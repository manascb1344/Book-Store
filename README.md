# 📚 Book Store Web App

Welcome to the Book Store web application! This repository contains both the frontend and backend code for a basic full-stack web app that empowers users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a curated collection of books.

## 🌟 Introduction

The Book Store web app is crafted to facilitate users in managing a virtual bookstore. It offers essential features such as adding new books, updating existing book details, deleting books, and seamlessly browsing the available inventory. The frontend leverages React.js for a dynamic and interactive user interface, while the backend, fueled by Node.js, efficiently handles data storage and retrieval using MongoDB as a robust NoSQL database.
